const upgradeValueReview = 'Evaluate upgrade and other setup effects by their marginal payoff. In combat, identify a specific eligible target from the visible hand, whether it is already upgraded, and whether remaining energy and card-play limits allow using it after setup. Separate immediate block or damage from the upgrade benefit; if the target cannot be played now, future payoff depends on retaining or redrawing it and the fight lasting long enough. Do not assume a combat upgrade permanently improves the deck. Use supplied upgrade text for exact gains; if unavailable, mark the gain uncertain rather than inventing it. For card rewards and purchases, count existing copies and already-upgraded cards, compare the added copy against skipping or other purchases, and account for drawing the setup card instead of needed damage or defense. Another copy needs an unmet need and useful targets, not merely a synergy label. Compare spending that energy on direct damage, defense or scaling. These are tradeoffs, not a ban on setup cards.';
const mechanicsInstruction = 'When visible rules make facing matter, inspect forecast.facingProjection when available (incoming uses its conservative upper bound), forecast.facingReview and the last targeted action in each proposed sequence. Choose the final orientation for the lowest survivable total from all remaining attackers, not automatically the last damage target. Reserve a cheap targeted card or legal targeted potion for turning when needed before spending all energy; compare its cost with block, kills and retaliation. If both sides attack, compare both totals; if only one attacks, consider facing that attacker. Re-observe displayed intents after turning before ending. Do not assume area attacks turn you, or multiply already-adjusted displayed damage by the back-attack bonus again. '+

 'Apply mechanics_review to each candidate using the supplied rules and recent observations: check triggers, positioning, damage modifiers, death effects and play limits. Explain to yourself how the proposed sequence changes those conditions before choosing. When ending is lethal and no known attack sequence kills, compare energy-then-draw continuations before spending all energy on damage. A prefix forecast assumes ending immediately; it does not prove its continuation fails. Unmodeled effects are uncertainty, not evidence that an unknown damage action is safer than a known energy prefix.';
const killReview = 'Before choosing block, compare affordable focused kill sequences. Read departedMinions as well: a supported leader kill removes those minions and their attacks without killing them. Do not assume other summons leave, or identify a leader from its name alone. Read defeatedEnemies and attackRemoved: killing one attacker prevents its displayed attack and removes future pressure, even if other enemies survive. Compare resulting HP loss and surviving enemies, not block totals or damage spread. Reserve energy for the kill before optional defense; use remaining energy to block other attackers. A kill is not automatically best when it triggers retaliation/revival or leaves lethal incoming damage. Unknown forecasts require checking visible rules, not dismissal. Jev must choose the tradeoff; no action is forced.';
const timingReview = 'Read potion_timing before spending cards or ending: compare use now, later this turn, and saving for each carried potion. Name the actions or healing ticks that benefit and whether delaying loses those opportunities. Lasting buffs and delayed healing deserve consideration at the beginning of combat, not only when HP becomes critical. Do not automatically consume: a short safe fight may justify saving, temporary buffs require follow-up, and block multipliers require block first and damage before expiry. Compare complete affordable known-hand sequences as well as short prefixes: identify whether spending energy on defense prevents a lethal attack or instead strands an attack that defeats the current form. Conditional protection applies only when its stated target condition holds. A visible revival means defeating that form requires re-observation, not assumed combat victory; do not invent next-phase stats. Evaluate HP-for-energy cards by net benefit: identify specific additional playable attacks, block or draw the energy enables, subtract the HP cost, and compare resulting survival and progress. An HP payment can preserve more HP through added defense or a kill; it can also be lethal or wasted when the hand cannot use the energy. For rewards and purchases, assess whether the current deck repeatedly runs out of energy with useful cards remaining rather than automatically favoring or rejecting HP-cost cards. Check setup_dependencies for visible prerequisite/payoff sequences. Exhaust before playing a card whose bonus requires exhausting this turn, preserving that payoff card and its energy. Compare draw early enough to use the results against spending the last energy on draw; draw can still have exhaust or other immediate benefits, so do not ban it. Before spending energy on block cards, compare using visible Dexterity or other block-enhancing potions first: these do not retroactively increase block already gained. Temporary buffs need usable triggers before expiry. Evaluate healing-over-time consumables early enough for their visible ticks to matter; do not assume healing occurs before a lethal hit without a stated timing rule. On turns with zero incoming attacks, distinguish useful draw, upgrades, retained block or other visible triggers from block that expires unused; compare damage and durable scaling using the same energy. For visible damage caps or charges, compare actual HP damage and charges removed per energy, not printed attack damage. Explain benefit through the supplied rules, without assuming every extra card play is good.';

Reconcile the prior unfinished plan with the new observation before choosing another setup action.

Compare what changed and whether the replacement actually improves survival or progress. Compare cheaper lethal attacks against overkill that consumes energy needed for defense. Include visible end-of-turn status-card effects; partial forecasts can omit lethal damage. Check whether setup actually triggers soon enough to help; a power with no available trigger may do nothing before lethal damage.
