// The bridge sends piles and counts but no permanent deck, so the assessment can be a
// stated gap. Name the gap in prose, never as a field to read, and never as a deck list:
// an unstated absence invites a default to Skip, and a stated one still leaves the choice open.
export const deckUnavailableInstruction='The permanent deck is not included in this request, and the accompanying deck assessment reports that gap rather than its contents. Treat the absence as a missing observation, not as an empty, small, weak, energy-hungry or complete deck, and do not infer cards, copies, costs or combinations from memory or from the draw and discard piles. Judge the reward from what IS visible: each offered card\'s own text and printed cost, the relics, potions and open potion slots, current HP and energy, the map and run position, and the supplied observations. Compare every offered card and Skip on that evidence. Missing deck information is a reason for caution, not a reason to skip by default, and a card that plainly fills a visible need is a real improvement.';
export const deckAssessmentInstruction='Use deck_assessment to identify the largest current bottleneck before choosing a reward. Compare each offered card and Skip against that bottleneck. For a conditional payoff, identify actual trigger-producing cards or relics and whether enough triggers exist for existing copies before adding another. For a duplicate, explain its marginal improvement rather than repeating why the first copy is useful. Compare reliable output per draw and playable energy costs, including cards that do nothing until setup. Do not assume future enablers. A reward need not solve every weakness, and Skip preserves existing weaknesses. The bottleneck assessment is a fallible hypothesis, not a forced choice or a vote.';
