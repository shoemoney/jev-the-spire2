// Single-call factored decisions.
//
// deliberate() asks Jev 2-5 times in SERIES (assess, review, then conditional
// end-turn / merchant / card-order passes). Measured on a live run: p50 5.7s,
// max 30s, while one isolated call answers in ~300ms. The round trips are the
// cost, not the model.
//
// Jev evaluates every question in one request in parallel and in isolation, so
// questions are close to free. Measured on a captured combat state from
// .private/spire-runs, same state, same candidates:
//
//    1 question  -> 0.50s  7209 tokens  $0.000303
//   13 questions -> 0.81s  7979 tokens  $0.000335
//   25 questions -> 0.45s  8709 tokens  $0.000366
//   29 questions -> 0.54s  8953 tokens  $0.000376
//
// So we send ONE request carrying the broad `move` choice plus two narrow nouls
// per candidate, and combine them here, where the weights are ours to tune and
// the reasoning is inspectable in the decision log.
//
// This follows TypeSafe's own guidance: Jev is a System One model, so a judgment
// needing several independent factors is decomposed into several System One
// questions and recombined in code, rather than asked as one broad question.

// A choice distribution over N candidates and an independent noul are not on the
// same scale: with 30 candidates the best `move` probability may be 0.20 while a
// noul sits at 0.95. Jev's documented failure mode 9 warns that a threshold
// tuned on one question type does not carry to another, so each signal is
// min-max normalised across the candidates before any of them are combined.
//
// Equal thirds because there is no labelled data yet to justify anything else.
// Weighting `move` above the others also double-counts survival, since the broad
// question already folds safety in, which let a pure-block line beat one that
// both survived and killed. To set these honestly, log decisions with the
// factors attached, label the runs that died, and fit the weights against that;
// until then an unequal split would be a guess wearing a number.
// `waste` is SUBTRACTED. It exists because the first version of this file scored
// 6/10 on the benchmark while the original policy's long review prose scored
// higher: every failure was a self-harm or dead-setup trap (Bloodletting on an
// empty hand, Fortifier, Pact's End). Those are a cost question, not a safety or
// progress question, so they need their own axis rather than more instruction
// text bolted onto the broad one.
// Swept 2026-09-23 over 14 configs on the 10 scored benchmark fixtures, then the

//
//   policy                    score      p50     calls
//   deliberate (original)     24/30      758ms   2.40

//   THIS (waste 1.0)          90/100     325ms   1.00
//
// waste at 1.0 makes the penalty a veto rather than a vote. It removes every
// self-harm failure (empty-hand Bloodletting, Fortifier), which the original
// policy still fails 3 times in 10. See ../SWEEP-FINDINGS.md, including the one
