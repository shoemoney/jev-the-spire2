# Jev The Spire 2

[![Watch the video](media/thumbnail-play.png)](https://youtube.com/@shoemoney)

**A robot plays Slay the Spire 2, and decides every move in about 315 milliseconds for half a
thousandth of a dollar.**

A fork of **[alexmeckes/jev-the-spire](https://github.com/alexmeckes/jev-the-spire)** (MIT), which
is where the Slay the Spire 2 integration, the planner, the fixtures and the benchmark suite come
from. All of that is his work. This fork adds a single-call factored decision layer, tail-latency
hedging, and a multi-model benchmark harness, then measures the result.

## What this fork adds

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `spire-demo/factored.mjs` | One request carrying the broad choice plus three nouls per candidate, recombined in code with weights you own |
| `spire-demo/hedge.mjs` | Staggered request hedging for a bimodally-slow endpoint, idempotent reads only |
| `spire-demo/benchmark/sweep.mjs` | Parameter sweep scoring latency against decision quality on fixed fixtures |
| `spire-demo/benchmark/vs-llm.mjs` | Head-to-head against any OpenRouter model on byte-identical state |

Results and method: **[SWEEP-FINDINGS.md](SWEEP-FINDINGS.md)**.

### Measured

Against the upstream multi-call policy, on the same graded fixtures:

| policy | quality | p50 | calls per decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| upstream `deliberate` | 24/30 | 758ms | 2.40 |
| **this fork** | **90/100** | **325ms** | **1.00** |

And against frontier models on identical state, 30 decisions each:

| model | score | p50 | $/decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| `moonshotai/kimi-k3` | 29/30 | 2,312ms | $0.01111 |
| `anthropic/claude-opus-5.5` | 29/30 | 3,590ms | $0.04704 |
| `anthropic/claude-fable-5.1` | 29/30 | 5,534ms | $0.11952 |
| `x-ai/grok-4.7` | 29/30 | 12,022ms | $0.01303 |
| **`typesafe/jev-1.13`** | 27/30 | **315ms** | **$0.00046** |
| `openai/gpt-6-astra` | 24/30 | 1,672ms | $0.03210 |
| `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` | 24/30 | 23,366ms | $0.00446 |

The quality gate is a narrow first-action error check on ten fixtures, not a win-rate. The noise
floor on that corpus is about +/- 3, so 27 and 29 are not separable. What is separable is 6x to 63x
on speed and 24x to 260x on cost.

### Running against OpenRouter instead of TypeSafe direct

This fork calls `https://openrouter.ai/api/alpha/decisions` with the model pinned to
`typesafe/jev-1.13`. Put an OpenRouter key in `.private/typesafe.cfg` as `api_key = "sk-or-..."`,
then:

```bash
SPIRE_SINGLE_CALL=1 node spire-demo/server.mjs    # dashboard on :4317
SPIRE_HEDGE=0 ...                                  # to disable hedging
```

Watch **TypeSafe Jev play Slay the Spire 2** on your computer.

Jev chooses cards, targets, rewards, routes, and purchases. A local dashboard shows its choices, competing options, and estimated outcomes. You can preview a decision, play one move, or turn on autoplay.

This is an experiment, not a solved-game bot. Its first verified Ironclad Ascension 0 victory came on archived run #182; that history spans multiple policy versions and is not a current-policy win-rate estimate.

## What you need

- **Slay the Spire 2**, installed locally.
- **[STS2MCP](https://github.com/Gennadiyev/STS2MCP)**, a compatible game mod that lets the app read game state and perform actions.
- **Node.js 22 or newer.**
- A **[TypeSafe](https://docs.typesafe.ai/api) API key** with credits. Playing and model-based benchmarks make paid API calls.

## Get started

1. Install and enable STS2MCP using its [installation instructions](https://github.com/Gennadiyev/STS2MCP#for-players). Launch the game. Its local API should respond at `http://127.0.0.1:15526/api/v1/singleplayer`.
2. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/alexmeckes/jev-the-spire.git
   cd jev-the-spire
   ```

3. Set your key and start the app (macOS/Linux):

   ```sh
   export TYPESAFE_API_KEY="your-key-here"
   npm start
   ```

   On Windows PowerShell, use `$env:TYPESAFE_API_KEY="your-key-here"` followed by `npm start`.

   There are no npm dependencies to install.

4. Open **http://127.0.0.1:4317**, start a normal singleplayer run in the game, and press **Autoplay**.

Use **Preview** to see a choice without playing it, **One move** to execute one decision, and **Pause** to take over. Pause prevents the next action; it cannot undo one already sent to the game.

**Mod compatibility:** game updates can break the bridge. Development used game v0.107.1 with STS2MCP source commit `55e064850a68f3b4cde7e5fd525bf9b2dec4e885`, built against the installed game. The 0.4.0 release binary did not work with that game version. See [bridge notes](docs/bridge.md) if the dashboard cannot connect.

## Watch the decisions

Open **http://127.0.0.1:4317/sidecar** for a compact companion panel. On macOS, `spire-demo/Open Jev Companion.command` builds and opens a floating window (requires Xcode command-line tools). The browser dashboard works without it.

The panel shows choices and probabilities, not a generated reasoning transcript. Confidence is not the probability of winning.

## How it works

1. Read the visible game state through the local bridge.
2. Build legal actions and short combat plans, with estimates for supported effects.
3. Ask Jev to choose.
4. Check that the state is still current and execute **only the first action**.
5. Observe again and repeat.

Jev is the only AI model making gameplay choices. Forecasts are incomplete: they do not know future draws or hidden enemy behavior. The app does not require screenshots or mouse control.

## Local data and limits

Your key stays on the local server. Game observations, candidate plans, and recent decision context are sent to TypeSafe. Gameplay logs and checkpoints stay in the ignored `.private/` folder. Never commit that folder or your key.

The server binds to localhost. Keep the game bridge local too. Default session limits are 2,000 decisions and 10 million input tokens; override `MAX_DECISIONS` or `MAX_INPUT_TOKENS` if needed. Displayed costs are estimates, not a billing meter.

Restarting restores the previous session **paused**. After a finished run, stop the server and rename `.private/spire-runs/session.json` to archive it before starting a separate session. Autoplay does not automatically start a new match after defeat.

## Progress visualizer

[**Jev the Spire**](https://jev-the-spire.alex900731.chatgpt.site) is the public hosted dashboard. The complete static visualizer and sanitized 182-run snapshot are included in [spire-demo/progress-site](spire-demo/progress-site). You can view them locally without a Sites account:

```sh
npm run progress
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:4390. Explore floors, strategy changes, individual run details, and recorded input/output token usage. Download the per-run CSV from the page. See [progress and accounting notes](docs/progress.md) for how the data is produced and what the totals exclude.

## Current baseline

The synced player uses `jev-visible-v23-retaliation` and `jev-visible-review-v24-card-order`: visible facing and deadline checks, deck evidence, retaliation forecasts, card-order review, and request compaction. Sword in Stone remains excluded. Leave `SPIRE_ADVISER` and `SPIRE_PLAN_BENEFIT` unset for baseline Jev. Optional experiment code is included for reproducibility and disabled by default; it is not part of the winning run's configuration.

## Tests

```sh
npm test
```

Tests run locally without an API key or a running game. The repo includes gameplay fixtures and controlled sequence tests for potion timing and card ordering.

`npm run benchmark:dry` checks the recorded-state benchmark inputs without API calls. [Benchmark notes](docs/benchmarks.md) explain the optional paid evaluations and their limits.
