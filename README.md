## 🙏 Credit where it belongs

This is a fork of **[alexmeckes/jev-the-spire](https://github.com/alexmeckes/jev-the-spire)**
(MIT). The Slay the Spire 2 integration, the planner, the decision fixtures and the grading
suite are all his work, and this repo keeps his full commit history rather than a squashed
snapshot. What this fork adds is a different decision layer on top, plus the measurement to
show whether it was worth doing.

The game bridge is **[STS2MCP](https://github.com/Gennadiyev/STS2MCP)** by Yikun Ji.

## 🧠 What the thing actually is

**[TypeSafe Jev](https://docs.typesafe.ai)** is a decision model, not a chat model. You hand it
a state and a set of typed questions, and it returns calibrated probabilities. It never
generates text, so there is no prompt begging for JSON and no fence-stripping regex on the way
back. Anthropic's Kahneman framing fits: it is a System One model, fast intuitive judgment, and
it is explicitly not built for extended reasoning.

That constraint is the whole design problem. **"Which card should I play?" is a System Two
question.** So this fork decomposes it into System One questions and recombines them in code:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    S["🎲 Board state<br/>+ legal actions"] --> R{{"📦 ONE request"}}
    R --> M["🎯 <b>move</b><br/>choice over every<br/>legal action or plan"]
    R --> SA["🛡️ <b>safe_&lt;id&gt;</b><br/>survives the displayed<br/>incoming attack?"]
    R --> P["📈 <b>prog_&lt;id&gt;</b><br/>real progress<br/>toward winning?"]
    R --> W["🩸 <b>waste_&lt;id&gt;</b><br/>pays a cost whose payoff<br/>cannot be collected?"]
    M & SA & P & W --> N["⚖️ normalise each signal<br/>(deadband 0.15)"]
    N --> C["🧮 apply weights we own"]
    C --> A["✅ argmax → action"]
```

Every question in that request is evaluated **in parallel and in isolation**, which is the part
that makes it work. 🔑

<details>
<summary><b>⚖️ The weights, and why <code>waste</code> is a veto</b> (click to expand)</summary>

<br>

From [`spire-demo/factored.mjs`](spire-demo/factored.mjs):

```js
export const WEIGHTS = { move: 0.25, safe: 0.25, progress: 0.25, waste: 1 };
export const DEADBAND = 0.15;
const MAX_FACTORED_CANDIDATES = 64;
```

`waste` carries 4x the weight of any other factor because it is not a preference, it is a veto.
The failures it catches are self-harm and dead-setup traps — Bloodletting on an empty hand,
Fortifier, Pact's End — which the other three factors are structurally incapable of noticing.
Adding it was worth **+20 points**. See [`SWEEP-FINDINGS.md`](SWEEP-FINDINGS.md).

## 📊 The measurements

### Questions are free. Round trips are not.

Same board, same candidates, four samples each:

| questions | input tokens | cost | median latency |
|---|---|---|---|
| 31 | 18,236 | $0.000766 | 487ms |
| 85 | 23,096 | $0.000970 | 457ms |
| **160** | 29,846 | $0.001254 | **491ms** |

**160 questions answer as fast as 31.** Tokens scale, latency does not. So a decision needing N
judgments costs **one request, not N** — and the upstream policy's 2.4 sequential calls per
decision were the entire latency problem. 🎯

### 🆚 This fork vs upstream, same graded fixtures

| policy | quality | p50 | calls per decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| upstream `deliberate` | 24/30 (80%) | 758ms | 2.40 |
| **this fork** | **90/100 (90%)** | **325ms** | **1.00** |

### 🏁 vs frontier models, byte-identical state, 30 decisions each

| | model | score | p50 | p90 | $/decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🥇 | `moonshotai/kimi-k3` | 29/30 | 2,312ms | 69,963ms | $0.01111 |
| 🥇 | `anthropic/claude-opus-5.5` | 29/30 | 3,590ms | 9,025ms | $0.04704 |
| 🥇 | `anthropic/claude-fable-5.1` | 29/30 | 5,534ms | 12,964ms | $0.11952 |
| 🥇 | `x-ai/grok-4.7` | 29/30 | 12,022ms | 31,624ms | $0.01303 |
| ⚡ | **`typesafe/jev-1.13`** | 27/30 | **315ms** | **585ms** | **$0.00046** |
| | `openai/gpt-6-astra` | 24/30 | 1,672ms | 3,284ms | $0.03210 |
| | `deepseek/deepseek-v4.1-flash` | 24/30 | 23,366ms | 82,839ms | $0.00446 |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Read this honestly.** The quality gate is a narrow first-action error check on ten fixtures.
> The grader says so itself: *"not optimality or win probability."* The noise floor on that corpus
> is about **±3**, so **27 and 29 are not separable** and Jev is **not** "smarter" than Claude here.
> What *is* separable, and by a lot, is **6x–63x on speed** and **24x–260x on cost**.

Also worth saying: **Opus 5.5 is the best LLM on this board and it is not close.** Same score as
Fable at 35% lower latency, 60% lower cost, and a far tighter tail. 👏

## 🩸 Three things that cost real time to learn

<details open>
<summary><b>1️⃣ A factor that did not separate the candidates still voted at full strength</b></summary>

<br>

Min-max normalising each signal fixed the scale mismatch between a choice probability and a
noul — but when every candidate scored within 0.01 of the others, it stretched that gap into a
full 0-to-1 swing. **Three factors shouting about nothing.**

A `DEADBAND` of 0.15 raw spread, below which a factor returns neutral, was worth **+16 points**
on its own.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>2️⃣ Capping the fan-out to save money silently disabled the factoring</b> 💀</summary>

<br>

At a cap of 28 candidates, **6% of decisions exceeded it and 7% of all candidates got no factor
questions at all** — always on the busiest boards, which is exactly where you need them.

It cost a run. At **7 HP against three enemies telegraphing 17 damage**, the top three
candidates came back `safe=None prog=None waste=None` with confidence 0, and the agent died two
decisions later.

The cap is now **64** — above the largest board observed (53), with headroom under the 64k
request context.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>3️⃣ The endpoint's latency is bimodal and it comes and goes</b> 🎭</summary>

<br>

Measured on identical payloads: a **fast cluster at 0.34–0.79s** and a **slow cluster at 7–16s**,
with nothing in between. Waiting longer never helps; issuing a second identical request does,
because it draws again. Hence [`hedge.mjs`](spire-demo/hedge.mjs).

Four hours later the slow mode was **gone entirely** and the hedge never fired across 480
decisions.

> **Never tune a timeout from one sitting.** The hedge is insurance whose value is zero while the
> service is fast and large when it is not, so the delay sits just above fast-mode p99 (~650ms)
> where it costs nothing to carry. 900ms stands.

</details>

## 🔧 Setup

You need **Slay the Spire 2**, **Node.js 22+**, and an
**[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/keys) key**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shoemoney/jev-the-spire2.git
cd jev-the-spire2
```

### 🔑 Where the key goes

> [!WARNING]
> **Nothing in this repo auto-loads `.env`.** There is no `dotenv` — the dependency list is
> empty on purpose. A `.env` file sitting in the repo root is read by *nobody* unless you pass
> Node's built-in `--env-file` flag. Pick one of the two paths below; both are verified.

| | Path | How | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🅰️ | **`.private/typesafe.cfg`** *(simplest)* | `api_key = "sk-or-v1-..."` | every entrypoint, automatically |
| 🅱️ | **`.env` + explicit flag** | `cp .env.example .env`, then always launch with `node --env-file=.env ...` | only when you pass the flag |

And the two variable names are **not** interchangeable:

| variable | what actually reads it |
|---|---|
| `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` | `server.mjs` (the app you run), `benchmark/run.mjs`, `run-sequences.mjs`, `evaluate-plans.mjs` |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | `benchmark/sweep.mjs`, `benchmark/vs-llm.mjs` |

Both are the **same OpenRouter key**. Only `vs-llm.mjs` has no `.private/typesafe.cfg` fallback,
so that one genuinely needs the environment variable set.

## 🎮 The game mod

Install [STS2MCP](https://github.com/Gennadiyev/STS2MCP).

> [!CAUTION]
> **On Slay the Spire 2 v0.111+ the prebuilt DLL does not load.** It dies with
> `ReflectionTypeLoadException: Could not load type ...Multiplayer.LobbyPlayer`.

The compatibility fix lives in **[upstream PR #132](https://github.com/Gennadiyev/STS2MCP/pull/132)**,
which is **still open** and lives on a **fork** — so `git checkout fix/v0.111-compat` against
`Gennadiyev/STS2MCP` will not find it. Clone the fork directly:

```bash
git clone --branch fix/v0.111-compat https://github.com/DarkArcZ/STS2MCP.git
cd STS2MCP
git apply /path/to/jev-the-spire2/spire-demo/vendor/deck-state.patch
dotnet build STS2_MCP.csproj -c Release -p:STS2GameDir="/path/to/Slay the Spire 2"
```

✅ **Verified 2026-09-24:** the vendored [`deck-state.patch`](spire-demo/vendor/deck-state.patch)
applies cleanly to that branch at commit `199cf59` (one hunk, offset 7 lines).

The patch exposes the visible permanent deck for deck-building decisions. It changes observation
data, not game rules. Without it, permanent-deck context may be unavailable.

🍎 **On macOS** the mods folder lives inside the app bundle at
`SlayTheSpire2.app/Contents/MacOS/mods/`, and the game **must be launched through Steam** or
Steamworks init fails with `No appID found`.

📖 Full bridge contract, verified-build provenance, and the older v0.107.1 build notes are in
**[`docs/bridge.md`](docs/bridge.md)**.

## 🚀 Run it

```bash
SPIRE_BETTER_POLICY=1 node spire-demo/server.mjs   # dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:4317
```

Start a normal singleplayer run in the game, then press **Autoplay**. 🚀

<details>
<summary><b>🎛️ Every runtime flag</b></summary>

<br>

| variable | default | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `SPIRE_BETTER_POLICY` | *unset* | `1` enables one-call screen-specific decisions, bounded encounter memory, and a calculated fatal-end-turn guard. The companion launcher enables it unless set to `0`. |
| `SPIRE_SINGLE_CALL` | *unset* | `1` enables single-call factored decisions. **Unset falls back to the upstream multi-call policy.** |
| `SPIRE_HEDGE` | `1` | `0` disables request hedging |
| `SPIRE_PLAN_BENEFIT` | *unset* | enables the plan-benefit scoring path |
| `SPIRE_ADVISER` | *unset* | `luna` runs the opt-in Luna advisory experiment ([details](spire-demo/experiment/README.md)) |
| `PORT` | `4317` | dashboard port |
| `MAX_INPUT_TOKENS` | — | stop threshold for a run |
| `MAX_DECISIONS` | — | stop after N decisions |

When both fast-policy flags are set, `SPIRE_BETTER_POLICY` takes precedence.

🍎 macOS users can also double-click **`spire-demo/Open Jev Companion.command`**, which builds the
native companion app on first run, starts the server if port 4317 is quiet, and opens it.

| `.private/` | Your key, raw run logs, benchmark output. **Never committed.** |

<details>
<summary><b>🎬 How the media is generated</b></summary>

<br>

The thumbnails and outro are rendered from **plain HTML** — no design tool in the loop, so a copy
change is a text edit and a re-screenshot:

| Source | Renders to |
|---|---|
| `media/thumb.html` | `thumbnail-play.png` |
| `media/thumb-vs.html` | `thumbnail-vs.png`, `thumbnail-vs-play.png` |
| `media/outro.html` | `outro.mp4` (20s) |

The full upload cut (`media/shoemoney-agent-plays-*.mp4`) is **gitignored** — it is far too large
for the repo. `tools/youtube-meta.json` points at it by name; supply your own file at that path.

**Two things that bite the uploader**, both documented at the top of
[`tools/youtube-upload.mjs`](tools/youtube-upload.mjs):

- Until the Google Cloud project passes API audit, **every upload is forced private** and cannot
  be made public through the API. Not a bug in the script.
- Quota is 10,000 units/day; an upload costs ~1,600 and a thumbnail ~50 — about **six uploads a
  day**, then HTTP 403 `quotaExceeded` until midnight Pacific.
